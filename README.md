### A XKCD Discord bot

A simple Python Discord bot that takes in a XKCD comic number and returns a URL, relying on embeds to provide the actual
 comic image and alt-text. It also allows the user to input a string and get a guess at a relevant XKCD. 
 Finally, no argument returns the latest XKCD.

**New!** Because life is complicated, you can now request the ExplainXKCD page of a particular comic.

Credit for name goes to [BobbyTablesBot on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/BobbyTablesBot/).

The search is entirely based on [adtac's Relevant XKCD search API](https://github.com/adtac/relevant-xkcd).
It wouldn't be possible without him, so many thanks there!
